This is my college project.
• Real-time pizza order tracker app using
NodeJs, Express and Mongo DB in 2021.
• In this project I build a real-time online
pizza order app using Node Js, Express Js
and MongoDB.
• By using tailwind css for front end as a css
framework and by using EJS template
engine as well. I used socket.io for
real-time communication.
• Using This app we will be able to order a
pizza and get real-time notifications about
pizza status.
